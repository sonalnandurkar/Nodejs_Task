#Nodejs_Task

In this task I build api that will allow user to upload csv file.
I eliminate all blank rows, insert a column at the beginning to assign a serial number to each row.
Then I export the result as an .xlsx(excel file) and generate a pie chart to represent gnder ratio as .png
Upload the files to /public folder and return the file URL in API response.
